# 📈 Time Series Stock Market Forecasting

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting stock market trends using various time series models, as part of my internship at ZIDIO Technologies.

We explored multiple forecasting techniques on historical stock data to understand time-based patterns and make short-term predictions using both statistical and deep learning methods.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Understand time series concepts: trend, seasonality, stationarity, noise.
- Preprocess and analyze real stock market data.
- Implement and compare the following models:
  - ARIMA
  - SARIMA
  - Facebook Prophet
  - LSTM (Deep Learning)
- Evaluate model performance using visualization and metrics.

## 📊 Tech Stack

- Language: Python  
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - `yfinance`, `pmdarima`, `statsmodels`
  - `fbprophet`
  - `tensorflow.keras` for LSTM
- Optional Tools: Streamlit or Flask for deployment (not implemented in this version)

## 📌 Results & Insights

- ARIMA & SARIMA: Performed well on Reliance stock, good for modeling linear trends.
- Prophet: Provided intuitive trend-seasonality decomposition, easier for business understanding.
- LSTM: Captured complex patterns in Tesla stock using a deep learning approach.

Visuals and evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, residuals) were used to assess performance.
